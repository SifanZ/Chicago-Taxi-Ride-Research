# Chicago-Taxi-Ride-Research


The project aims to explore the Chicago Taxi Market. While mobile taxi services like Uber and Lyft have significantly impacted customers’ commuting behaviour, traditional taxi services still dominate a certain portion of the transportation market. Our project focuses on the traditional Chicago taxi market from the perspective of companies using Spark, investigating their operational situations and customers’ payment behaviours over the years to help them develop further business strategies.
